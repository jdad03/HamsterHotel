- Brief Description- The boss gave us a prototype and we had to duplicate it near 1/1 using our own code also we had to make sure it was responsive within Ipad and Iphone.

- Review: I just reviewed your Hamster Hotel project and it doesn't meet all the requirments. You have white spaces on the left and right of your main background image. At the very end of your website you also have a blank horizontal space. Your "introduction" section is not centered and the logos are not the correct size. Your "rooms" section looks good but you have borders outlining them. You're missing a header in your "package" section. The images and text is not in the proper position. Your "amenities" section is too small and doesn't have the proper positioning. In your "reserve" section, the header "reserve" has a different back ground than the other background colors. The image doesn't occupy the full length of the column either. There's lots of room for improvements but I look forwards to working with you in the future.
